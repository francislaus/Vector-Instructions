# Description

The task of the function is to add the elements of two vectors
`a` and `b` and write the result into the vector `c`. The length
of all vectors must apparently be equal and is specified via
an input parameter. Each vector element is a 32 bit wide floating
point number. Vectors are implemented via arrays.
